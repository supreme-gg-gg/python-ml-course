Helpful link for installing tensorflow (with GPU acceleration) on Mac

I have confirmed that the second solution at the very bottom does work!

That is, after deleting and reinstalling for more than 4 times lmao...

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72964800/what-is-the-proper-way-to-install-tensorflow-on-apple-m1-in-2022

`conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict 
 
conda create -y --name cv
conda activate cv
conda install -y -c apple tensorflow-deps==2.10.0
python -m pip install tensorflow-macos==2.10.0
python -m pip install tensorflow-metal==0.6.0

python --version
conda list|grep -E '(tensorflow|numpy)'`

Apple provided this simple test to verify if it is working or not: https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/

If the above way is not clear this also works: https://github.com/deganza/Install-TensorFlow-on-Mac-M1-GPU/blob/main/Install-TensorFlow-on-Mac-M1-GPU.ipynb
