# Machine Learning Notes

## Abstract

This is my personal coding notes from the Machine Learning Specialization (3 courses) that I took during my free time on Coursera in ~1 month. [You can access the course by Andrew Ng here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) and audit it for free, great learning resources!

It built some foundation for my other AI project in quantitaive finance (which I will link below once finished). These codes are not meant to be used for academic or commercial purposes but purely for individual learning.

## Table of Content

Here's a summary that you might or might not find useful:

Course | Topic | Files
--- | --- | ---
Supervised learning 1 | Linear regression | linear.py, regularisation.py, restaurant.py
| Logistic regression | logarithmic.py, sklearn-regression.py, microchip.py
Supervised learning 2 | Neural Networks | coffee-numpy.py, multiclass.py, coffee-tf.py
| Evaluate models | optimize-neural.ipynb, digits.ipynb, digits2.ipynb
| Decision trees | trees.ipynb
Unsupervised/Reinforcement | Unsupervised algorithms | anomaly.ipynb, clustering.ipynb
| Reinforcement | policy.py, lunar-rover.ipynb

_Honestly, the organisation is pretty chaotic..._

## How to use

If you are interested in seeing some of these for inspiration or any other purposes, setup the environment using `conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt`. If you are not using conda setup a venv and install the libariries using `pip install --upgrade numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras gym scikit-learn`. Explore around or run the codes, not everything will run beautifully of course. **These codes are not meant for production or distribution, so there is absolutely no rigorous testing and quality verification process.** I will not be responsible for maintaining contents of this repo.

_Finally, wish you good luck in learning AI and ML!_ I really found this to be an intruiging field of study especially when you get to witness everything underneath the hood of all its cool applications!
