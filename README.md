# Machine Learning Notes

## Abstract

This is my personal coding notes from the Machine Learning Specialization (3 courses in total) I took during my free time on Coursera. [You can access the course by Andrew Ng here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) and audit it for free. They are some great learning resources and took just around one month for normal speed.

It built some foundation for my other AI project in quantitative finance (which I will link below once finished). These codes are not meant to be used for academic or commercial purposes but purely for individual learning.

## Table of Content

Here's a summary that you might or might not find useful:

| Course | Topic | Files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supervised learning | Linear regression | linear.py, regularisation.py, restaurant.py |
|                    | Logistic regression | logarithmic.py, sklearn-regression.py, microchip.py |
| Deep Learning | Neural Networks | coffee-numpy.py, multiclass.py, coffee-tf.py |
|              | Evaluate models | optimize-neural.ipynb, digits.ipynb, digits2.ipynb |
|              | Decision trees | trees.ipynb |
| Unsupervised/Reinforcement | Unsupervised | anomaly.ipynb, clustering.ipynb |
|                           | Reinforcement | policy.py, lunar-rover.ipynb |

_Honestly, the organisation is pretty chaotic..._

## How to use

* If you want to see some of these for inspiration or other purposes, set up the environment using `conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt`. 

* If you are not using conda set up a venv and install the libraries using `pip install --upgrade numpy matplotlib tensorflow keras gym scikit-learn`.

* Feel free to explore around and run the codes. You can copy any part of this repo for your own use.

* **These codes are not meant for production or distribution, so there is absolutely no rigorous testing and quality verification process.** I will not be responsible for maintaining the contents of this repo.

* The data files are attached and connected already

_Finally, I wish you good luck in learning AI and ML!_ I really found this to be an intriguing field of study especially when you get to witness everything underneath the hood of all its cool applications!
